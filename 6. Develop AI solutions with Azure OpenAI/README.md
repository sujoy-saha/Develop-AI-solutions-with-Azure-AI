Azure OpenAI brings the generative AI models to the Azure platform, enabling a developer to build powerful AI solutions that benefit from the security, scalability, and integration of other services provided by the Azure cloud platform. It provides access to OpenAI's powerful large language models such as GPT, Codex, and Embeddings models. Generative AI models power ChatGPT's ability to produce new content, such as text, code, and images, based on a natural language prompts. Many generative AI models are a subset of deep learning algorithms. It can be accessed through REST APIs, Python SDK, or the Azure OpenAI Studio web-based interface
